                <center><h2>SEJARAH LARI DALAM OLIMPIADE</h2></center>
                    <p>Ketika Komite Olimpiade Internasional (IOC) menggelar Olimpiade modern pertama pada 1896 di Yunani, ada sembilan cabang olahraga yang dipertandingkan yaitu atletik, 
                        bersepeda, anggar, gimnastik, menembak, renang, tenis, angkat berat, dan gulat. Adapun, lari yang masuk cabang olahraga atletik pada Olimpiade 1896 meliputi lari 100 meter, 400 meter, 800 meter, 1500 meter, 110 meter gawang, dan marathon. Ketika pertama kali dilombakan pada Olimpiade modern, 
                        lari hanya diikuti oleh atlet pria. Thomas Burke dari Amerika Serikat berhasil meraih medali emas pada nomor lari 100 meter dan 400 meter. Sementara itu, rekan senegara Burke yakni Thomas Curtis merebut medali emas nomor 110 meter lari gawang. Di nomor 800 meter dan 1500 meter, medali emas diarih oleh Edwin Flack. 
                        Kemudian medali emas nomor marathon menjadi milik pelari Yunani, Spiridon Louis.</p>

                <p>Elaine Sandra-Lee Thompson-Herah CD OD (n√©e Thompson; born June 28, 1992)[3] is a Jamaican sprinter who competes in the 60 metres, 100 metres and 200 metres. Regarded as one of the greatest sprinters of all time, she is a five-time Olympic champion, the fastest woman alive in the 100 m, and the second fastest alive in the 200 m.
                    Thompson-Herah is the first ever female sprinter, and the second sprinter after Usain Bolt, to win the "sprint double" at consecutive Olympics, capturing 100 m and 200 m gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics, and defending both titles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. A six-time Olympic medallist, she rose to prominence at the 2015 World Athletics Championships, winning silver in the 200 m and, at the time, becoming the fifth fastest woman in history over the distance. The next year at the Rio Olympics, she became the first woman since Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 to win 100 m and 200 m gold at the Olympics.
                    After the Rio Olympics, Thompson-Herah was plagued by an Achilles tendon injury, which affected her performance at the 2017 World Athletics Championships and the 2019 World Athletics Championships. However, she returned to the top of athletics at the Tokyo Olympics, retaining her 100 m title in a new Olympic record of 10.61 s, and her 200 m title in a new personal best and national record of 21.53 s. After winning a third gold medal in the 4 x 100 m relay, she became the third sprinter after Griffith-Joyner and Bolt to complete an Olympic sprinting triple.
                    At the 2021 Prefontaine Classic, Thompson-Herah set another 100 m personal best, Jamaican and Diamond League record of 10.54 s, becoming the first woman to break the 40 km/h barrier, then ran times of 10.64 s and 10.65 s. For her season she was voted Laureus Sportswoman of the Year, and World Athletics World Female Athlete of the Year. One of the most dominant sprinters in the world, she is the 100 m 2019 Pan American Games champion and a three-time Diamond League winner. In 2022, retired American sprinter Michael Johnson called Thompson-Herah and her compatriot Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce the two greatest female sprinters of all time.[4]</p>

His gold medal finish at the 2020 Olympics was the first Canadian Olympic gold in track in 25 years and the first in the 200 m in 93 years. A consistent podium finisher, he won a medal in every Olympic and World Championship final he competed in from 2015 until the 2023 World Championships.</p>
